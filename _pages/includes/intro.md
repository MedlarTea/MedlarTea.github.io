I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Hong ZHANG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), since September 2022. My research is centered around Robotics, with a special focus on robot perception and decision making. At present, I am developing a 'Robot Person Following' system, enabling the robot to follow/accompany the user consistently and naturally. The ultimate goal of this system is to enable robots to exhibit the reliability and attentiveness of a loyal pet, thereby enhancing the capabilities of personalized robot assistance.
